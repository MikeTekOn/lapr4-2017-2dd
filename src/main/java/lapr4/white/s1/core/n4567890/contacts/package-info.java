 * <b>Attention: This feature increment and this documentation are work in progress! You should question what is already done!</b>
 * 
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 * 
 * -Notes about the sprint's work.-
 * <p>
 * -In this section you should register important notes regarding your work during the sprint.
 * For instance, if you spend significant time helping a colleague or if you work in more than one feature.-
 *
 * <h2>2. Requirement</h2>
 * 
 * A sidebar window that provides functionalities for creating, editing and removing contacts. Each contact should have a first and last name and also a photograph. Each contact should also have one agenda in which events related to the contact should be displayed. For the moment, events have only a due date (i.e., timestamp) and a textual description. It should be possible to create, edit and remove events. The agenda may be displayed in a different sidebar. This sidebar should display a list of all events: past, present and future. <p>
 * One of the contacts should be the user of the session in the computer where Cleansheets is running. If this user has events then, when their due date arrives, Cleansheets should display a popup window notifying the user about the events. This popup window should automatically disappear after a small time interval (e.g., 5 seconds).
