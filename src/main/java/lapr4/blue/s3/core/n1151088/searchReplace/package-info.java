/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story Core07.3: Search and Replace
 * <p>
 * JIRA issue: LAPR4E17DD-23
 * </p>
* <p>
 * <b>Scrum Master: no</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: no</b>
 *</p>
 * <h2>1. Notes</h2>
 *
 * <p>This functional increment is the continuation of the <b>Core07.2: Global Search</b>
 * 2017/06/13- started analysing the user story
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h2>2. Requirements</h2>
 * <p>
 * The extension should now include a new option "Search and Replace". This new
 * window should be similar to the search window but with an area to enter the 
 * replacing text. When search and replace is launched, when a match is found, 
 * the window should display "what" and where the match has occurred and how it
 * will become after the replace. The user should then confirm the replacement 
 * or select next (to continue the search). The window should include a button 
 * to apply the replacing to all the matches without asking each time. Similarly 
 * to the search only option, this option should also have parameters to refine
 * the search, for instance, what type of cells to include in the search (or if 
 * it should include formulas or comments).
 * </p>
 *
 * <b>Use Case "Search and Replace":</b>

 * 
 * <b>Open Questions</b>
 * <p>When the window display "what", in case of a sentence/coment, how it
 * should be displayed?
 *   Answer: It doesnÂ´t needed to be included all content but maybe the adjacent
 * text.
