/**
 * Technical documentation regarding the user story Lang01.1: Block of Instructions.
 * <p>
 * <b>Area Leader: yes</b>
 * <p>
 * <h2>1. Notes:</h2>
 * <p><ol>
 * <li><b>This feature increment and this documentation are work in progress! It was already partially elaborated.</b>
 * <li><b>Spent significant time analyzing the already implemented code base for this feature.</b>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>2. Requirements</h2>
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>Add the possibility of writing blocks (or sequences) of instructions. A block must be delimited by curly braces and its instructions must be separated by ";".
 * <li>The instructions of a block are executed sequentially and the block "result" is the result of the last statement of the block. For example, the formula "= {1 + 2; sum (A1:A10); B3 + 4 }"
 * must result in the sequential execution of all expressions and the result is the value of the last expression "B3 + 4".
 * <li>Add the assign operator (its symbol is ":="). This operator assigns to its left the result of the right expression. At the moment the left of the assign operator can only be a cell reference.
 * <li>Add a FOR loop statement (should also be implemented based on instruction blocks). For example, the formula <pre>{@code "= FOR {A1: = 1 ; A1 < 10; A2: = A2 + A1; A1: = A1 + 1 }"}</pre>
 * executes a for loop in which: the first expression is the initialization, the second term is the boundary condition, all other expressions are performed for each iteration of the loop.
 * </ul><p>
 * <p>
 * <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
 * <p>
 * <b>Attention:</b>
 * In the class csheets.core.formula.util.ExpressionVisitor it was necessary to add a new method to support visiting the new type of operator "naryoperator" (it did not exist in the original code of Cleansheets).
 * This will add an "uncommon" dependency between the core code and the lapr4 code!<p>
 * <p><ol>
 * <li>Before we start the actual feature increment, we have to analyze the existing code base.
 * <li>This use case regards essentially the formula compiler and executer. It does not seem to have any impact in other areas of the application.<p>
 * <li>The entry point for the execution of the formula compiler is the method setContent of the interface Cell.<p>
 * <li>The setContent method basically does three things:<p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>storeContent(content);    = this compiles the content and produces a Formula object and updates cell dependencies based on the Formula<p>
 * <li>fireContentChanged();     = this notifies listenners about content changes<p>
 * <li>reevaluate();             = this executes the Formula and notifies listenners about value changes<p>
 * </ol></li>
 * <li>The recognized operators are being loaded from the language.props (cleansheets core package), except for the new implementations of <b>sequence operator</b>
 * and <b>assignment operator</b> that are concrete java classes that implement an operator interface.
 * </ol><p>
 * <p>
 * <h3>3.1. Analysis details</h3>
 * - <b>3.1.1. storeContent</b><p>
 * -- Executes formula=FormulaCompiler.getInstance().compile(content)  = this will select the instance of ExpressionCompiler based on the "starter char"<p>
 * -- compile<p>
 * --- will execute the FormulaParser (generated from ANTLR) to obtain the parser tree.<p>
 * --- the parser tree is then traversed and an Expression is generated.
 * <p>
 * - <b>3.1.2. How the parser and executer work together</b><p>
 * -- Antlr will generate a parser tree. The parser tree includes nodes for grammar elements that are marked with ""^ as a suffix. The other elements in the same rule will become child elements of the node. The elements that are marked with the "!" suffix are not included.<p>
 * -- For instance, the following grammar rule:<p>
 * -- L_CURLY_BRACKET^ comparison ( SEMI! comparison )* R_CURLY_BRACKET <p>
 * -- will generate a node for the L_CURLY_BRACKET and all other elements will be child nodes. The SEMI terminal will not be include in the child elements.
 * <p>
 * - <b>3.1.3. Converting parser tree to Expressions</b><p>
 * -- Each ExpressionCompiler (ExcelExpressionCompiler or any other) will traverse the nodes of the parser tree and generate an Expression for each node. At the end the result is a tree of expressions.<p>
 * -- The next diagram illustrates the Expression interface and its hierarchy.<p>
 * -- For the block the idea is to have a new class to support n-ary operations.<p>
 * -- For the assignment the idea is to implement it as a binary operator.<p>
 * <p>
 * - <b>3.1.4. For loop statement</b><p>
 * -- Should have a initializer (based on a assigned operator expression)<p>
 * -- Should have a boundary condition (boolean expression)<p>
 * -- All <i>n</i> sequential expressions should be preformed until the boundary condition is met.<p>
 * -- The idea is to have a new class to extends the n-ary operator.<p>
